# Google OAuth Setup Instructions

This application now supports Google OAuth authentication. Follow these steps to set it up:

## 1. Create Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API
4. Go to "Credentials" in the left sidebar
5. Click "Create Credentials" â†’ "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
6. Choose "Web application" as the application type
7. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - For development: `http://lms.local:8000/auth/google/callback`
   - For production: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/google/callback`

## 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://lms.local:8000/auth/google/callback
```

## 3. Features

- **Login with Google**: Users can sign in using their Google accounts
- **Register with Google**: New users can create accounts using Google
- **Account Linking**: Existing users can link their Google accounts
- **Profile Integration**: Google profile information (name, email, avatar) is automatically imported
- **Email Verification**: Google-authenticated users are automatically email-verified

## 4. User Experience

- Users see "Sign in with Google" and "Sign up with Google" buttons on login/register pages
- Clicking the button redirects to Google's OAuth consent screen
- After authorization, users are redirected back to the application and logged in
- Google profile pictures are stored as user avatars
- Users can still use traditional email/password authentication alongside Google OAuth

## 5. Security Notes

- Google OAuth tokens are handled securely by Laravel Socialite
- User passwords are randomly generated for OAuth users (not used for login)
- All OAuth flows use HTTPS in production
- User data is only stored locally after explicit consent

## 6. Testing

To test the Google OAuth functionality:

1. Ensure your `.env` file has the correct Google OAuth credentials
2. Visit `/login` or `/register`
3. Click "Sign in with Google" or "Sign up with Google"
4. Complete the Google OAuth flow
5. Verify you're logged in and redirected to the dashboard
